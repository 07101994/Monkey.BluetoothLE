## MFMetadataProcessor

MFMetaDataProcessor is a tool that converts a .NET .exe file to be loaded and used on a .NET MicroFramework (.NetMF) compatible microcontroller such as the Netduino. NetMF controllers need a specialized assembly that is basically a bucket of IL with a small amount of wrapping code.
