 2. Select **Debug** in the build bar, and your **Netduino 2** as the device and hit the **>** button to deploy.


## 2 - Deploy the Mobile App

Expand the **MobileApp** solution folders, and right-click on the platform app (e.g. iOS or Android), Set as Startup Project, and deploy.

> Note: there is currently a bug in the Android app that we're working on, so for right now, only the iOS App works.
