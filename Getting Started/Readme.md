# Getting Started
Quick guide to getting a basic motile robot with simple object avoidance behavior (optional)

# Part 1 - Building the Robot
The first step is to assemble the robot chassis.

## Step 1: Solder the Motor Wires

Solder a black and a red wire to the flat metal leads coming off each of the motor. Photo to come later. :( To solder:

 1. Remove the plastic motor retainers (it may help to use needle-nose pliers to pull them down, off the lip).
 2. heat your soldering iron, and tin the tip (you can get soldering iron tip cleaner and tinner at radioshack) 
 3. bend the wire ends in half, put through the leads and clamp shut. 
 4. Hold the iron on the wire + leads for about 5 seconds, and apply solder.

## Step 2: Assemble the Motor

Screw the motor attachment block onto the motor with two of the long bolts. NOTE: the image shows the bolts backwards. While it'll work this way, it'll also put the bolt ends very close to the wheel wells when it's fully assembled, so I would reverse them as seen in the image below. Note that you'll create two of these assemblies, each mirroring each other:

Note that yours should have wires coming off the motor by this point.

## Step 3: Bolt the motors to the plate

Use the small bolts to attache the motors to the plate as shown:

## Step 4: Attach the Wheels and Tires

Push the tire/wheel assembly onto the motor axle (it takes a bit of pressure and finesse). Then, using 4 small bolts and nuts, attach the front wheel to the front of the plate:


## Step 5: Attach the Battery Pack

Using two small bolts and nuts, attach the battery pack to the back of the chassis:

## Step 6: Run the Motor Wires through the Chassis

This will get them out of the way and make it so they're long enough to reach the motor controller.
