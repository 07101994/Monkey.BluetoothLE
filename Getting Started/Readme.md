# Getting Started

These guides will get you up an running with Monkey.Robotics. By the end of these guides, you'll have a working motile robot that you can drive around with your iOS or Android device over bluetooth!


## Setup and Configuration

The first step to using Monkey.Robotics is to setup your hardware, build enivronment, and test your micro-controller out with a simple app.

### 1. [Configuring Your Build Environment and Hardware](ConfiguringBuildEnv.md)

This guide will help you get your development environment and Micro Framework hardware all setup so you can build and deploy project.

### 2. [Creating a First App](FirstMicroApp.md)

After you got your hardware and environment configured, it's time to build a simple app that blinks the onboard LED on your netduino to make sure everything is configured and running properly.

## [Getting Started with the Micro Stack](Micro_Stack)

The Micro Stack follows the Reactive Programming pattern with composible Blocks that represent components of the underlying circuits. Check out the [Getting Started with the Micro Stack guide](Micro_Stack) for more information.


## [Getting Started with the Mobile Stack](Mobile_Stack)

The Mobile Stack runs on iOS and Android devices via the Xamarin platform and enables BLE communication with microcontrollers. Check out the [Getting Started with the Mobile Stack guide](Mobile_Stack) for more information.
